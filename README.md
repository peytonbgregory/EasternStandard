# Eastern Standard Developer Challenge

## Overview

One of our favorite clients has referred us to one of their colleagues who's having trouble with an application demo they're supposed to present to the CIO.

They hired a "rock star" freelance developer to begin building the application, but it's not going as well as they had hoped. The developer originally promised a working prototype in a week. It's now been a month and he's saying it'll take at least another week.

Ultimately, the application is supposed to be a robust management platform for their employees to manage their personal information, submit timesheets, and perform a host of other data management tasks. It will also need to link to other data sources/other internal applications at the organization. For now, though, all they want is a prototype of a few basic functions to demo to the CIO.

They want us to fix this demo, and fast! It's Monday and we need to show something to the CIO on Friday. __For the sake of this exercise, assume you have to fix what's here rather than doing something completely from the ground-up.__

## The application needs to do the following for the sake of the demo:
* Allow employees to login and edit their employee records
* An employee record should consist of:
  * First Name
  * Last Name
  * Date of Birth
  * Phone Number
  * Office number (i.e. the room in the building in which they work)
  * Employee category (full time, part time, intern, contractor)
  * Allow administrators to login and edit any employee record

Note that there are also some bugs in the code and potential problems with the architecture - see if you can identify them.
If you have difficulty, focus on your strengths. If your frontend chops are where you are most confident, show some things you would do with the interface. If your strengths lie on the backend, work with the architecture and the API. For full stack candidates, we'd like to see an approach that covers both frontend and backend.

## In addition to the demo, the client wants a few things from us:
* They've asked for an audit of the code. They want to understand whether this new developer really has the code chops they claimed they did
* If we make it through the demo, we have the opportunity to take the project over. They want to know what you'd recommend long term. 

## Your presentation:

We expect candidates to spend 4-8 hours on this exercise. You are welcome to spend less or more depending on what you feel is viable for the sake of the demo as outlined above. 

You'll be meeting with our internal team to showcase how you've solved this problem. You'll start by reviewing it with a team of developers, then we'll invite other members of the team (project managers, designers, etc) to see your approach. You should be prepared to:

* Show the internal team your demo and talk about how it meets the client requirements above
* Note any gotchas or specific details the team should be aware of before it gets officially pitched to the client
* Provide your assessment of the original architecture, before you modified anything. How does it work/how's it set up? What's good? What's bad? 
* Describe some of the specific things you changed for the demo / walk us through the code. 
* Note any specific issues/bugs you found in the code.
* What would you recommend the client do from here if they wanted to continue building on this and turn it into a larger scale employee management system? Feel free to simply talk through it or show us a version that you built and why you chose to do it differently.
